# Weather Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to forecast essential weather parameters, such as **temperature**, **pressure**, and **humidity**. By analyzing data from the **'World Weather Repository'** on Kaggle, we uncovered insights into weather trends and developed predictive models with high accuracy.

### Key Objectives:
- Predict key weather metrics with high precision.
- Explore and visualize trends in weather data.
- Conduct advanced analyses, such as anomaly detection and feature importance.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and outliers for reliable data quality.
- **Feature Engineering:** Added derived features like **daytime duration** and **feels-like temperature** to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Normalization:** Used Min-Max Scaling and transformations for consistent data representation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trends:** Seasonal variations in temperature and humidity identified.
- **Correlations:** Strong relationship between temperature and humidity uncovered.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Regional differences visualized using maps.

### Machine Learning Models
- **XGBoost:** Achieved **R² = 0.91**, effective for general predictions.
- **SVR (Support Vector Regressor):** Achieved **R² = 0.98**, excellent for time series predictions.
- **Random Forest:** Provided insights into feature importance.

### Advanced Analyses
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identified unusual weather patterns.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlighted critical factors influencing predictions.
- **Climate Impact Insights:** Explored environmental trends.
